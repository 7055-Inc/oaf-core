# API Gateway Architecture

## Overview

This document outlines our API Gateway architecture using Nginx as a reverse proxy to provide a secure, scalable interface between clients and our database server. This approach provides enhanced security for personal information, consistent API handling, and centralized control of all data access.

## Architecture Diagram

```
Internet → Nginx API Gateway → Application Server → Database Server
                       │
                       ├→ Route API requests
                       ├→ Apply rate limiting
                       ├→ Handle SSL
                       ├→ Log API access
                       └→ Authentication layer
```

## Components

### 1. Nginx API Gateway

**Purpose:** 
- Serves as the single entry point for all API requests
- Routes requests to appropriate backend services
- Provides initial security layer

**Key Functions:**
- Request routing based on endpoint
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- SSL termination
- Access logging
- Basic request validation
- CORS handling

### 2. Application Server (API Backend)

**Purpose:**
- Implements API business logic
- Handles authentication and authorization
- Processes requests and formats responses

**Key Functions:**
- User authentication (via Google Identity Platform)
- Request validation and sanitization
- Business logic implementation
- Response formatting according to API standards
- Error handling and logging

### 3. Database Server

**Purpose:**
- Stores and manages all application data
- Provides data security and integrity
- Optimizes data access

**Key Functions:**
- Data storage and retrieval
- Transaction management
- Data validation
- Backup and recovery

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Gateway Configuration

1. Configure Nginx as reverse proxy
2. Set up basic routing for API endpoints
3. Implement SSL and security headers
4. Configure logging and monitoring

### Phase 2: API Standardization

1. Implement standard API endpoints
2. Add authentication middleware
3. Standardize response formats
4. Document API specifications

### Phase 3: Integration Testing

1. Test end-to-end request flow
2. Verify security measures
3. Performance testing
4. Load testing

## Security Benefits

1. **Layered Security Model:**
   - Multiple security checkpoints before reaching sensitive data
   - Defense in depth approach

2. **Controlled Access:**
   - Single entry point for all data access
   - Comprehensive authentication and authorization

3. **Data Protection:**
   - Personal information never directly exposed
   - Encrypted connections throughout the pipeline
   - Limited database access permissions

4. **Monitoring & Auditing:**
   - Centralized logging of all API access
   - Anomaly detection
   - Comprehensive audit trail

## Test Implementation Path

To validate the architecture, we will implement a simple test path:

1. **Database Component:**
   - Create a test table with two fields:
     - `is_active` (boolean) - Controls whether the message is active
     - `message` (varchar) - Stores a simple message ("Hello World")

2. **API Endpoint:**
   - `GET /api/v1/test` - Returns the current message if active
   - `PUT /api/v1/test` - Toggles the active state

3. **Frontend Component:**
   - Simple switch UI to toggle the message state
   - Display area to show the current message

This simple implementation will test the complete flow from frontend through the gateway to the database and back, establishing a pattern for all future API development.
