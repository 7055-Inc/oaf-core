# 🏗️ **PHASE 2: Permission System Redesign**

## 🎯 **Strategic Architecture Shift**

**Current Problem**: Route files proliferating based on user types and permissions, hardcoded access controls, inconsistent permission patterns.

**New Solution**: Dashboard-centric permission system with user types + additive permissions model.

## 📋 **Permission System Architecture**

### **User Types (Baseline Identity + Profile Structure)**
- **`admin`** - System administrators → Gets admin profile + **automatic ALL permissions**
- **`artist`** - Individual artists → Gets artist profile tables, artist-specific UI
- **`promoter`** - Event organizers → Gets promoter profile tables, event-focused UI  
- **`community`** - Customers/general users → Gets community profile tables, customer-focused UI

### **Permissions (Opt-in Business Capabilities)**
- **`vendor`** - E-commerce capabilities (products, orders, policies, terms management)
- **`manage_sites`** - Website management (restricted to artists/promoters only)
- **`manage_content`** - Content creation (articles, topics, SEO)
- **`manage_system`** - System administration (users, announcements, domains)

### **Access Scoping Pattern**
- **Regular Users**: `/my` endpoints only (their own data)
- **Admin Users**: `/my` + `/all` endpoints (everyone's data)
- **Permission Restrictions**: Only certain user types can get certain permissions

### **Dashboard URL Structure**
```
/dashboard/{usertype}?permissions={permission1,permission2}
```

**Examples:**
- `/dashboard/artist?permissions=vendor,manage_sites` - Artist who can sell + manage websites
- `/dashboard/promoter?permissions=vendor` - Promoter who can also sell products
- `/dashboard/admin` - Admin gets all permissions automatically
- `/dashboard/community` - Customer with no additional permissions

## 🗄️ **Database Schema Changes Required**

### **1. Update user_permissions Table**
```sql
-- Current (granular):
vendor, create_articles, publish_articles, manage_articles_seo, manage_articles_topics

-- New (logical groups):
vendor, manage_sites, manage_content, manage_system
```

### **2. Create permission_restrictions Table**
```sql
CREATE TABLE permission_restrictions (
  permission_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  allowed_user_types JSON NOT NULL,  -- ['artist', 'promoter'] for manage_sites
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### **3. Admin Auto-Permissions Logic**
- Admin user type gets ALL permissions automatically (no database flags needed)
- Simplifies permission checks: `if (req.roles.includes('admin')) return next();`

## 🔄 **Route Consolidation Impact**

### **Routes to Consolidate via Permissions**
1. **`vendor.js` → `dashboard.js`** (vendor permissions)
2. **`admin.js` → `dashboard.js`** (admin user type + manage_system permission)
3. **Permission-based endpoints within core routes** (products/my vs products/all)

### **Routes to Keep Separate (Core Domains)**
- **`users.js`** - Core user management (but add /my vs /all pattern)
- **`products.js`** - Core product system (but add permission checks)
- **`events.js`** - Core event system
- **`applications.js`** - Core business workflow

## 📐 **Implementation Phases**

### **Phase 2A: Database Schema Updates** ✅ **COMPLETED**
1. ✅ Created new permission columns (logical groups): manage_sites, manage_content, manage_system
2. ✅ Created permission_restrictions table with user type restrictions
3. ✅ Migrated existing granular permissions to new groups
4. ✅ Added admin auto-permission logic

### **Phase 2B: Permission Middleware Updates** ✅ **COMPLETED**
1. ✅ Updated JWT to include all permission groups
2. ✅ Created comprehensive permission middleware with restriction validation
3. ✅ Demonstrated replacement of hardcoded user type checks (sites.js, domains.js)
4. ✅ Implemented /my vs /all access patterns

### **Phase 2C: Route Consolidations** ✅ **COMPLETED**
1. ✅ Created dashboard.js framework for consolidating vendor/admin functionality
2. ✅ Built permission-based dashboard overview with dynamic sections
3. ✅ Demonstrated consolidation patterns for future migration
4. ✅ Established foundation for cleaning up permission-specific route files

### **Phase 2D: Frontend Updates** 📋 **READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION**
1. Update dashboard to use new /dashboard/overview endpoint
2. Consolidate permission-based UI components using new structure
3. Test user type + permission combinations with new API
4. Gradually migrate from old vendor/admin routes to dashboard routes

## 🚫 **Permission System Rules**

### **User Type Restrictions**
- **`manage_sites`**: Only artists and promoters can get this permission
- **`vendor`**: Any user type can get vendor capabilities
- **`manage_content`**: Any user type can get content creation
- **`manage_system`**: Only admins (automatic) and explicitly granted users

### **Admin Privileges**
- **Automatic ALL Permissions**: Admin user type gets every permission by default
- **Cross-User Access**: Admins can access `/all` endpoints for any domain
- **User Management**: Only admins can manage other users (never delegated)

## 🎯 **Expected Benefits**

1. **Scalability**: New permissions don't create new route files
2. **Security**: Clear /my vs /all access patterns
3. **Flexibility**: Any user type can get business capabilities as needed
4. **Maintainability**: Centralized permission logic vs scattered hardcoded checks
5. **Business Logic**: Aligns technical architecture with business roles

   - **Why Cancelled**: API keys ARE the authentication mechanism for 3rd party access
   - **Critical Issue**: Authentication infrastructure must remain separate from user management
   - **Lesson**: API keys don't require authentication to get - they ARE the authentication
   - **Actions Taken**: 
     - ✅ Restored `api-keys.js` file exactly as it was
     - ✅ Restored server.js route mounting
     - ✅ Reverted frontend API calls
     - ✅ Restarted API service
   - **Status**: RESTORED AND WORKING ✅

❌ **Admin Financial → Admin** **CANCELLED - DEVELOPMENT PHASE**
   - **Files**: `admin-financial.js` → `admin.js`
   - **Why Cancelled**: Still in development/planning phase - not ready for consolidation
   - **Lesson**: Don't consolidate routes that are still being actively developed
   - **Status**: CANCELLED ❌

- **`auth.js`** - User authentication 
- **JWT middleware** - Token verification
- **CSRF protection** - Security layer

### 🚫 **NEVER CONSOLIDATE (Core Business Systems)**

- **`products.js`** - E-commerce core system (product catalog, variations, inventory)
- **`users.js`** - User management core (profiles, authentication, permissions)
- **`events.js`** - Event management core (listings, types, custom events)
- **`applications.js`** - Application workflow core (connects users+events+billing+calendar)
- **`carts.js`** - Shopping cart core (complex cart logic, session management)
- **`checkout.js`** - Payment processing core (Stripe integration, order management)

**Reasoning**: These systems are core business domains that serve as integration hubs connecting multiple other systems. They have complex workflows, multi-role permissions, and sophisticated business logic that would be diluted if consolidated.
