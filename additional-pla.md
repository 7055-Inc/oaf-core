## Implementation Priorities

Based on business impact and technical dependencies, we recommend the following implementation sequence:

1. **Media Management System** - Foundation for all visual content
2. **Search and Discovery System** - Critical for product findability
3. **Reviews and Ratings System** - Builds trust and engagement
4. **Admin Dashboard** - Essential for platform management
5. **Analytics and Reporting** - Provides business intelligence
6. **Events and Exhibitions System** - Differentiating marketplace feature
7. **Messaging and Communication System** - Enhances user interaction

## Technical Approach

Each system should follow these implementation principles:

1. **Modular Architecture**: Each component should be self-contained but with clear integration points
2. **API-First Design**: Well-defined API contracts between frontend and backend
3. **Progressive Implementation**: Start with MVP features and iterate based on user feedback
4. **Reuse of Common Patterns**: Leverage existing authentication, state management, and UI components
5. **Performance Optimization**: Consider scalability and performance from the beginning
6. **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests for each component

## Next Steps

1. Prioritize these components based on business requirements and user feedback
2. Create detailed implementation plans for each component, similar to existing product, user, and cart plans
3. Establish development timelines and resource allocations
4. Begin implementation with the highest priority component
